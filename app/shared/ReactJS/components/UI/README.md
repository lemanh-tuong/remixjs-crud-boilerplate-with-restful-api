# Overview

This folder contains UI components associated with ReactJS, designed for use across multiple projects. These components provide reusable and consistent user interface elements to streamline the development process.

The "UI" folder focuses exclusively on the display and visual aspects of the application. It handles the presentation layer and is easily adaptable for integration into different modules, including the "Features" module.
